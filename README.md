# Question (aka Challenge Mode)

Silly little thing that exists for the sole purpose of me learning how to use
[Sequelize]() with Node/Express.  Basics are done, at this point I'm just adding
features as I go.  Feel free to fork/copy/mess with it as much as you'd like.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/sethborden/questions.git && npm install`

Questions uses the [bcrypt](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js) package
which in turn uses [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp).  If you're
installing under Windows this sometimes causes issues which can be resolved
(sometimes) by making sure that you have your PYTHONHOME variable pointing to
the right folder.  Go [here](https://futurestud.io/blog/how-to-build-nodegyp-to-run-bcrypt-on-windows) for a more in depth
explanation.
